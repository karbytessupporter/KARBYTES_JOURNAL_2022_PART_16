<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I decided to delete the tweet I recently made which is depicted in the screenshot image below because I wrote that tweet while feeling irritated at how far off human civilization seems to be from what I think it &#8220;ought&#8221; to be. I wrote it on the BART train on my way from Castro Valley to Dublin this morning on my way to the Smart &amp; Final store to submit my I-9 employment verification documents. After that, I got a nostalgic winter holiday feeling while walking around the area I used to work in late 2019 and early 2020 (i.e. Gotta Eatta Pita) and where I used to regularly hang out (in small parking garages next to corporate buildings in 2021) and rent motel rooms at (Motel 6 up until it got too expensive for me to rent a room). The golden morning light and the hustle and bustle inspired me. I walked into the Starbucks store across the street from Gotta Eatta Pita on Owens Drive to get some hot coffee but saw that the line inside the store was very long and decided that I would get more bang for my buck if I get cold brew coffee from the Whole Foods Market on the other side of the 580 freeway instead. I am not sure where I am going today or what I will be doing this weekend. I will probably attempt to do online training videos wherever I can get a decent Internet connection and not use up my mobile AT&amp;T data.</span></p>
