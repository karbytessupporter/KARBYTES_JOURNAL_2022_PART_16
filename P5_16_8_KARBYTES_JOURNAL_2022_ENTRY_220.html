<p>I was considering publishing a survey post on <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> asking other Twitter users for their input on what the legal consequences of my domestic violence misdemeanor from 2018 should be (and that misdemeanor was throwing a stainless steel teaspoon at the back of a family member&#8217;s head during a heated argument while I was standing on the stairs and the target was on the first floor). Then I decided not to publish that Twitter survey because, in the past, very few people engaged with my posts (and I do not want to dwell on this subject for any longer than necessary while waiting for people to participate in my survey only to see that they are deliberately trying to make me feel ostracized, punished, and neglected as a result of them refusing to participate).</p>
<p>I remember that my conviction was labeled by the local justice system as a misdemeanor and I was jailed at Santa Rita County Prison for no longer than a month (after being hospitalized at John George Psychiatric Hospital for approximately three days). As far as I can tell, I was treated as fairly as I ought to have been (i.e. the &#8220;punishment&#8221; was not excessively severe nor what I would call a violation of my basic human rights). Sadly, and with great dread and even hatred, there seem to be people (mostly strangers) who seem to think that I deserve to be punished more harshly (and I see them trying to take matters into their own hands by stalking me and harassing me in me in public).</p>
<p>The screenshot image displayed below captures a portion of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a> in which people are discussing their opinions on retribution and how criminals should be treated in response to committing a crime. I agree with the answerer that criminal justice should be handled by the government and not by mere civilians because, from what I can tell, those who are trained for roles in law enforcement and criminal justice are better equipped to handle emotionally charged conflicts which they are not personally directly involved in (as either perpetrator of some crime or else victim of some crime) than are people who are not trained and certified experts in that domain and/or who are likely going to favor more punitive and primal forms of criminal reform than would the professional third-party mediators.</p>

<p>I tried calling AJP twice in a row with less than a minute between both calls hoping to get his opinion on the matter I was thinking of making a Twitter survey about earlier. I think AJP is one of the anonymous persons using <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;technological telepathy&#8221;</a> to communicate with me 24 hours per day every day (and that he is one of the people who thinks I deserve to be punished more severely and that I deserve to suffer more than I think I ought to in retaliation for the violent misdemeanor I described above and for other social faux pas I committed in his eyes).</p>
<p>To me it seems that AJP and other people think that, as punishment for not fitting in better with society, I deserve to be ignored and not allowed to participate in large-scale social events nor even use the campus I am technically still a student at (i.e. California State University East Bay in Hayward,&nbsp; California (and my student ID is ef4645)) because I am considered too unapproved of and unappreciated to be deserving of happiness, health, and the personal satisfaction and social leverage of pursuing an education.</p>
