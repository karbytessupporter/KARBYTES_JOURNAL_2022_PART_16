<p>After spending about a week urban camping in Dublin, California, I decided to break to go up to Castro Valley, California. Today I rode the BART train from Dublin BART station to Castro Valley BART station and walked to my dad&#8217;s house near the Lake Chabot Golf Course. That is where this note is being typed. I am sitting in my personal storage room while playing a <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/dungeonRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dungeon role-play game sound generator</a> web application. I recently took a shower, dumped out my menstrual cup, and put my dirty clothes in the washing machine using plant-based lavender detergent which I bought from the Whole Foods Market in Dublin.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the garage today, I saw the garage door open with Brea the cat sitting on the red carpet in the middle of the room. She walked out onto the cement driveway to greet me. While in the garage, I grabbed my mail from the mail box and found both a per-qualified Capital One Walmart credit card and a citation notation saying that I owe the government $321 for evading BART fare. At present, I am waiting to hear back from multiple employers who offered me jobs and which I submitted paperwork for. Smart &amp; Final said that my tentative start date is 19_OCTOBER_2022 and I already placed an order for a store shirt and bought myself a pair of dark blue jeans and a black belt from the Target store in Dublin. I will go ahead and apply for the credit card and use that to pay the citation before the due date (which is 28_NOVEMBER_2022).</p>
<p>Both my parents know that I bought magic mushrooms recently and neither one seems disapproving. I showed the mushrooms I had to my dad today and he said he used to do that stuff back in his young adult days. I feel like there is a global revolution taking place where the idealism and open mindedness of the 1960&#8217;s and 1970&#8217;s is being resurrected and the icky 1980&#8217;s vibe will eventually dissipate in its wake.</p>
<p>I am smoking copious amounts of marijuana and about to play the drums for a bit while I wait for the washer-to-dryer laundry cycle to complete. Cheerio(s)!</p>
