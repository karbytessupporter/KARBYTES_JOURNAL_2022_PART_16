<p>If I could press a button which would quickly (but not necessarily painlessly) end my father&#8217;s life (and nothing bad would happen to me as a result of pressing that button) I almost certainly would.</p>
<p>My father has been one of my biggest bullies in my life. He has done many things over the past few years which suggest that wants me to feel deprived of privacy, space and time to pursue my hobbies and a dream career, and happiness in general. I am traumatized from the time he confiscated my backpack with my laptop and survival gear in it as punishment for not waiting for him to pick me up from the jail one of the times I was arrested for a non violent crime. (Rather than wait for him to pick me up in his car, I walked to the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station from Santa Rita County Jail (which is less than one mile and all on flat, well lit, and clean grounds), rode the BART train to Castro Valley BART station, and walked to my legal address (i.e. my father&#8217;s house) in Castro Valley). There are many more examples of what looks like passive-aggressive and gaslighting tactics which my father has deployed against me in an effort to derail my sanity and goals, but I would rather not mention them. What I see my father doing is spending most of his life stalking me and pretending not to be interested in my life in an effort to make sure I stay deprived of an enjoyable life. He has little in the way of hobbies and seems to want me to be deprived of a life outside the home so that I can rot in a dead-end role in a place where I feel deprived of the kinds of friendship and lifestyle options I really prefer.</p>
<p>I would (probably) not press that button to kill my mother because, from what I can tell, she is not as deliberately cruel and conniving as is my father and only she has been able and/or willing to give me money. (I am at least ten times more likely to press the button to annihilate my father than I would be to annihilate my mother and I am significantly more distressed by my mother&#8217;s suffering than I am by my father&#8217;s suffering; many orders of magnitude more). I would be relieved if I found out my dad died tonight. If both my parents died tonight, I would feel more relieved than distressed because I know I have what I need to survive and not having zero chance of ever having to deal with my parents again would mean that I no longer have to deal with their dysfunctional and sadistic behavior. (I think my parents both have sadistic tendencies and are addicted to me being in an almost constant state of extreme and &#8220;private&#8221; suffering while they seem to gloat about it and egg it on).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;"><em>To be clear, I live in much more dread of my father than I do of my mother because I have seen my father become a well-practiced &#8220;deep fake&#8221; and fanatic about deriving sadistic pleasure from seeing me in pain every chance he gets like it is his sole mission in life (and people seem to treat him like he is infallibly innocent and deny that he has ever done anything deliberately harmful while I am treated as an irredeemable criminal deserving of cruel treatment). That is a major reason why I am voluntarily homeless and spend as little time in my hometown as possible.</em></span></p>
<p>(If I press the button to kill my mother in that hypothetical situation, I would if I thought she was trying to sabotage my highest priorities and she was using her social status and wealth to hire people to sabotage me on her behalf&#8230;people like my father).</p>
<p>People are welcome to disapprove of what I wrote in this journal entry (or in any part of the World Wide Web). People can accuse me of libel, slander, doxing, hate crimes, lying, stealing, vandalism, and even physical violence. There is a probability greater than zero that I will intentionally try to kill a human other than myself (but I prefer that probability remain less than one percent).</p>
<p>Ideally, I would only commit physical violence against another human being in self defense and in order to prevent myself from getting seriously harmed by the person I think is trying to seriously harm me. I would like to promise that I will never premeditate plotting the death or injury of another human being such as by poisoning it&#8217;s coffee with cyanide, et cetera.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">If readers would like to &#8220;private message&#8221; me, they may do so by messaging me through my social media accounts or by emailing me. (See the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home page</a> of this website for links to my social media accounts and email addresses (which are listed in the AUTHOR_NETWORKING section of the home page)). I would greatly appreciate honest feedback.</span></p>
