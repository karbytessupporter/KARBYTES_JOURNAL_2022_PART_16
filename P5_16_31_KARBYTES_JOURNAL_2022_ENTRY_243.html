<p>It has been disconcerting to me that basically no one has bothered giving me feedback on whether or not my websites are visible to them. (My fear is that my websites are being censored such that only I and select others see them while most people cannot because my websites are blocked from their search engine results and/or the website URLs are blocked whenever someone attempts to go directly to one of those URLs). Perhaps when I have a reliable source of income, I will use some of my money to pay other people to provide feedback on my websites (and I do not mind how embarrassing and awkward I may come across to such people). I would feel better if I knew my websites were not being censored from the public Internet. My websites are supposed to be accessible to any terminal of the Internet (including public library computers). Only a reader with sufficient knowledge and reading skills would be &#8220;triggered&#8221; by my content because there is nothing otherwise controversial about my websites. To most, I imaging my websites look like long, wordy, boring, neurotic, and incoherent ramblings of an extreme introvert who has nothing to do but dream and bask in the beauty of nature and show off its &#8220;nerd cred&#8221;. Therefore, I think my websites should be accessible to school library computers as well (at least at universities if not at K-12 schools).</p>
<p>By the way, I found one website which allows me to pay some consultant $3/minute for a minimum of 15 minutes to review my website (<a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://protofuse.com/website-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://protofuse.com/website-consulting/</a>). I would ask that consultant how the CSS is rendering on its end and whether or not there are any broken links or &#8220;access denied&#8221; error messages. As long as I have a sufficiently high and sufficiently frequent amount of monetary income, I can use money to purchase things which would otherwise require that I sell my loyalty and servitude to some other person(s).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">By the way, I heard a voice say something like, &#8220;He forgot to put a door on his house,&#8221; and I immediately interpreted that sentence as a metaphor for building an Internet presence. One needs a personal website in addition to social media profiles in order to promote content, gain readership, and make it possible for visitors to interact with their readers using a peer-to-peer platform (i.e. social network) and not through something less reliable such as email and submitting messages via website forms. I also thought about how many years it took me to get as good at building and using my Internet presence as I currently am. I had to go through a lot of trial and error and suffering to get this good. It made me want to tell some imaginary people who are younger and/or less experienced at website management than I am, &#8220;You have to take action in order to get results (and there is no guarantee that any particular action is going to yield the results you want).&#8221; Then I thought about how I do not really believe anyone has free will and that free will is merely an illusion. If that is the case, I would say that success and luck are interchangeable. I think that people end up attracting the results they subconsciously most want (which means that not all avenues are explored at one time by one partial frame of reference). If and when I take <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-MeO-DMT</a>, I wonder whether or not I will get to experience all phenomena (and all space-time continuums) simultaneously while high. I might not remember such an experience when I return to sobriety, but I still think such an experience is worthwhile. If I do get to have such an experience, I would get to relive the experience of me writing this note while sitting beneath a night sky in the middle of a field next to the 580 freeway in Dublin, California with the glowing Oracle buildings about 300 meters in front of me (in addition to every other permutation of experience imaginable and which myself and/or others have experienced firsthand).</span></p>
