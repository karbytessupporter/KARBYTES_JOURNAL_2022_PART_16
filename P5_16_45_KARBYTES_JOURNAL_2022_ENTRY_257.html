<p>I have decided to try to get into the habit of not talking out loud to myself. Even if I say a single word it takes effort to &#8220;finish&#8221; the thought I had which was pertaining to that word. An apt metaphor which illustrates that phenomenon is the falling of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dominoes</a> (i.e. labeled ceramic tiles) in succession as one tile falls onto one of its neighboring tile. According to my understanding of the world, me saying one word out loud tends to make it easier for me to say another word out loud (and harder to not say another word out loud). Therefore, if I want to remain mute, I should avoid saying a single word (unless speaking is necessary to my survival and livelihood).</p>
