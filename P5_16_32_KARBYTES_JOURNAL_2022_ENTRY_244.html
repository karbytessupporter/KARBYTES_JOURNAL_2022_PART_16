<p>14_OCTOBER_2022: Before I get around to doing more intense psychedelics than psilocybin (especially the compound named 5-MeO-DMT and the DMT varieties which cause people to experience strange dream-like, &#8220;time-distorted&#8221; phenomenal renderings), I would like to confess that I am always skeptical about everything and that I have doubts that I will get to experience omniscience and/or to &#8220;realize infinity&#8221;. I even have doubts that all of reality is contained within exactly one mind. I have doubts that anything other than what I personally know to be real exists (though I am not as inclined to be a solipsist when it comes to my personal notion of reality than I am inclined to believe there are multiple universes concurring &#8220;simultaneously&#8221;).</p>
<p>(For more information about my worldview (in terms of what constitutes reality at the level of metaphysics and not anything less abstract), see <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a>, <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/determinism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DETERMINISM</a>, and <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTIVERSE</a>).</p>
<p>I am sitting on a bench in the tennis courts at the newly built Don Biddle community park about a quarter mile away from the Dublin BART station. The sky is clear with stars visible (but there seems to be more moisture in the air than last night (and that moisture seems to be causing the city lights to disperse in such as way as to obscure the starlight)). As I was walking into the court, I was thinking about what I could say to some of my weakest followers which would console them about the nature of suffering: &#8220;It&#8217;s only temporary. Eventually, all space-time trajectories which experience suffering will eventually end and whatever consciousness was rendering those hellish space-time trajectories will get to &#8216;teleport&#8217; to some other space-time trajectory.&#8221; Then I thought about how it is possible for the same partial frame of reference to go through the same permutation of phenomena multiple times (if not infinitely many times). A partial frame of reference which goes through infinitely many of the same hell &#8216;movies&#8217; are basically limited only to one kind of life. Partial frames of reference which are not that partial frame of reference which is relegated to an infinite hell loop seem to have no way to interact with that partial frame of reference which is relegated to that infinite hell loop. <span style="background:#ffff00;">If a partial frame of reference named X has been isolated inside of its own infinitely repeating hell loop and a partial frame of reference named Y which inhabits some other universe takes 5-MeO-DMT such that Y is able to instantaneously render all the lifetimes X goes through, then Y can at least be a witness to X&#8217;s experience (but Y may also be able to break X out of its hell loop by injecting information from outside of X&#8217;s universe into X&#8217;s universe as an act of &#8220;divine intervention&#8221; (but if Y is able to break X out of the infinitely repeating hell loop, the version of X which is freed from that infinitely repeating hell loop is not the same X as the X which is still relegated to an infinitely repeating hell loop because infinity implies that there may exist a space-time continuum which extends forever and infinity also implies that, from the perspective of nature itself, limitlessly many copies of one universe could possibly exist in parallel; otherwise the &#8220;infinitely repeating&#8221; hell loop which each version of X goes through would be a finite rather than infinite succession phenomenally identical loops)).</span> Well, that&#8217;s all the consolation I seem to have &#8220;on tap&#8221; at this hour.</p>
