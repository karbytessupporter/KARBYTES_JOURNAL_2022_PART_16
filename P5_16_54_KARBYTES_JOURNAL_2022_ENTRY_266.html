<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Today I asked my mother if she could help me pay for that BART fare evasion citation and she said that, although she did not have enough cash, she did have a credit card and was able to use her credit card to pay off the citation in full. Also today, I was able to get in contact with Smart &amp; Final store employees to discuss the next steps in my new hire onboarding and they said I should come into the store tomorrow morning with my I-9 documents because that is when the store manager is scheduled to be present. (To make sure that I do not oversleep, I plan on staying up all night tonight. Over the past two weeks, I have had difficulty going to sleep at night and have been mostly sleeping between 5AM and 11AM). I took a selfie of myself wearing my new stylish dark blue jeans (pants) which are neither tight nor loose fitting (which makes them slightly on the baggy and boxy side but neither &#8220;ghetto&#8221; (i.e. too baggy) nor &#8220;slutty&#8221; (too tight) (and if I were to pull of a &#8220;ghetto&#8221; look (which I might do once in a while once I have money to buy more luxuries, I might get some baggier jeans with chains hanging out of the pockets and some &#8220;blingy&#8221; chain necklace))), my crisp barely worn black t-shirt which I custom ordered from CafePress which displays &#8220;Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com&#8221; in bright green sans serif font. Then I shared that selfie on my Instagram, Twitter, Minds, and even Facebook profiles. Finally, over the past 48 hours, I have started to lose my desire for smoking weed out of that little carved wooden pipe because (a) that method of consuming THC is not very efficient (b) smoking (especially without water like in a bong to remove some of the harsh smoke particles) is painful and unhealthy to my respiratory system, and (c) I do notice that I am less drowsy and less attention span deficient when I abstain from smoking weed. Tonight I am planning on putting that weed smoking kit away in my room at my father&#8217;s house to keep as a memento of the past. I also plan on doing laundry, showering, and maybe even playing the drums. I still have about five grams of penis envy shrooms in a reused vitamin bottle in my backpack that I am waiting to do all in one sitting while sitting in a dark, secluded, and safe place perhaps sometime this weekend. While perusing Actualized dot Org forums, some forum user suggested that the best way to do shrooms is to do them in a dark, quiet, and safe place because that way allows one to &#8220;go deep&#8221; (whatever that means). Right now, I am not too woried about being able to get a job because my self confidence and optimism about the world at large has increased within the past three days (especially after getting each of the prose pages of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com as up to date as possible). The only anxiety I have left hanging over me like a dark cloud (besides the usual fear of becoming crippled, incarcerated, or dying &#8220;too soon&#8221;) is the dread of knowing I have to spend many hours (if not days) getting each of the code pages of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com up to date (and the thought police are especially intrusive and demoralizing whenever I attempt to do anything which looks like it might permanently upgrade my standard of living and self esteem (and I have only recently started to come to the conclusion that the thought police are more harmful than helpful and are legally entitled to be abusive bullies who lie, steal, and inflict psychological and even physical torture on targets like me. I have come to the conclusion that the thought police are fighting me relentlessly and vehemently every step I take towards my personal goals because those tyrants are jealous, lazy, insecure, chauvinistic, small-minded, anti-progressive, anti-intellectual, misery-mongering bigots who are desperate to prevent me from recovering from the many setbacks I have gotten into over the past few years. If there is any &#8220;takeaway&#8221; moral lesson I could say I gleaned as a result of being subject to such extremist bullying, I would say it is to not fall for the trap of siding with abusive, powerful tyrants merely because those people seem to get there way while others do not. No matter how much I admire and defend such bullies, there is no guarantee that my loyalty to them will be returned. Also, siding with the bully is anti-heroic because doing so is me implicitly suggesting that the bullies deserve to be treated like royalty merely because they use brute force, intimidation, and deceptive tactics to scam people, to steal from them, and to ruin their lives so that only the bullies get to thrive while everyone else lives in squalor and positions of relative powerlessness. I would rather be a humanist who advocates for every human&#8217;s welfare and who does not give into the temptation to be either a bully or else a helpless victim. Instead, I would rather be a &#8220;rational optimist&#8221; who makes lifelong learning, holistic fitness, and personal authenticity my highest priorities).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Breaking the Fourth Wall: I am cringing over how much my life could be described as &#8220;cringe&#8221;. I should not have dropped out of college. I should not have been so complacent about getting and keeping a job. I should not have assumed that life would be easier without my own source of financial income. I feel bad relying on my mother so much for money and for acting like a victim for so much of my life (and my blog is evidence of that). If I could boil down all my problems to one root cause, it would be me neglecting my basic personal responsibilities to the extent that I have become too financially crippled and psychologically (and physiologically) fucked up to even support myself (and I have not done much to be of service to others). Then again, I might just be reacting to all the putdowns which have been force fed to my brain by anonymous parole officers (and from plenty of civilians who seem to enjoy taunting and harassing me (and I think that many people prefer that I forever remain the token sheltered, spoiled, vain, and vapid princess character who is always a &#8220;newbie&#8221; and always an &#8220;outsider&#8221; and always &#8220;lonely&#8221; and painfully self conscious (and I notice that people tend to support that be the case instead of supporting the idea of me transcending such a miserable role))). Would I do the same as they are if the roles were reversed? I would if I was forced to do so at the threat of being seriously harmed or tortured (but if I had my way, I would not spam my target with any more input than necessary (and I would avoid being abusive even though being abusive to people on parole seems to be normal)). I would probably be fired or, at the very least, ridiculed by my colleagues for being such a &#8220;pussy&#8221; instead of a &#8220;hard ass&#8221;; for being too much of a nurturer and not enough of an intimidator. Oh well. I have very little knowledge about what really goes on &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; of what I experience. I often feel like I am walking around more ignorant than most other people are while doing my best to appear calm, civil, and productive even while feeling that I am being pranked at a large scale by other people and that other people know more about the prank than I do (and I imagine that more than 50% of the adults around me know about that prank while I am still not supposed to know that I am the sole target of that prank). Well, like many journal entries I have written, this is another example of gibberish with little facts to back up what I say. Though I try my best to be as informative as possible, I almost always feel that I am lacking vital information which would make me feel more authoritative about what I write about. I cannot help but assume other people prefer that I be deprived of the information and opportunities I need to be more of an expert and less of a designated &#8220;village idiot&#8221; for other people to ridicule and exploit.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Finally, I saw a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://www.wired.com/story/overemployment-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired article</a> show up in my Mozilla Pocket news feed which posits that the cure to being mentally burnt out by one job is taking on more than one job. That is essentially what I am doing in order to &#8220;move forward&#8221; with my life. My first job (which is not really a paid job) is working on my Internet based empire (especially by developing my personal websites). Working on my personal websites 24 hours per day and 7 days per week is more stressful than having other (productivity-oriented) activities scheduled into my routine so that (a) I do not get too bored of my personal website &#8220;business&#8221;, (b) so that I have an actual source of income which does not depend on my web development performance, and (c) so that I have more things to do, more places to go, and more people to interact with so that I am not so insulated from &#8220;the outside world&#8221;. When left to my own devices, I see how easy it might be for me to turn into a recluse who loses the ability to socialize productively and comfortably with other humans after spending &#8220;too much time&#8221; isolated and mulling over fringe topics which only a few weirdos and Internet addicts are interested in to the point of obsession. Then again, I cannot help but feel resentment towards &#8220;the people&#8221; for being mean to me and for trying to get in the way of me doing stuff which is more introverted, esoteric, and pensive than what &#8220;the people&#8221; condone. I feel coerced into being a sycophant who downplays how much I am interested in the stuff I prefer to do away from other people&#8217;s prying eyes and medddling ways.</span></p>
