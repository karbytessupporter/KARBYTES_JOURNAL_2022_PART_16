<p><em>To Whom It May Concern:</em></p>
<p><em>I apologize profusely for all transgressions I ever have committed, am committing, or ever will commit.</em></p>
<p><em>I am happy to be an inhabitant of Planet Earth at this time in human history (while embodied as an able bodied human individual).</em></p>
<p><em>I feel privileged to be an apex predator as I sit amidst birds, bees, squirrels, and other species which are decidedly not as powerful as I am with respect to the interspecies politics which govern the biosphere of this planet.</em></p>
<p><em>I sometimes look at &#8220;inferior&#8221; animals and fantasize them being terrorized for the sadistic amusement of humans (and I am ashamed to admit that I have taken pleasure in such an amusement).</em></p>
<p><em>I personally think that being a harmless schizoid is the best lifestyle for me. I wonder if it would become the norm if every other human had the chance to get as good of an education and holistic fitness options as I have. A more mindful human civilization would lead to a lack of unwanted human pregnancies (and more egalitarian, democratic, and non-cruel means to distribute scarce and coveted resources such as space, time, energy, nutrients, weapons, computing technologies, medical assistance, biomorhphic augmentation (for enhancement and for restoration of bodily functions), cloning, and other kinds of<br />
&#8220;stuff&#8221; which &#8220;government&#8221; and &#8220;capitalist corporations&#8221; seem to revolve around controlling.</em></p>
<p><em>I enjoy sitting outside</em> <span style="background:#00ffff;">&nbsp;&#8220;debajo del ciolo&#8221;&nbsp;</span>. <em>I enjoy observing the biodiversity, geology, weather, and celestial bodies which appear in my &#8220;living room&#8221;.</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em>Karlina Ray Beringer (@karbytes)</em></p>
